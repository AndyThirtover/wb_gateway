# minimal awt script for testing HGA
#
# --------
#
# The awt script syntax is based on a subset of twill script commands, 
# but has  been extended to allow asynchronous completion and overlapped 
# execution of requests.
#
# Basically, a twill command prefixed with a name is performed asynchronously,
# and the name is used to identify the request context.  When resting a result
# in a request context, the script is blocked as necessary for the result to 
# become available.
#
# twill commands without a context identifier are perormed synchronously in a
# "default" context for the running script.
#
# [[[Want a way to re-use a group of commands:  create a contrext tree so that
#    the names are local to the current containing context?  Then re-issuing 
#    commands in different contextx causes a new set of request contexts to be 
#    created.  Need to think about synchronization rules.
