						WebBrick to WebBrick Event mapping
==============================================================================================

This file shows some examples of mapping an event from one WebBrick to another.

In this case, WebBrick events are mapped to 'internal' events that then trigger WebBricks.

For simplicity this is based on one WebBrick and source and target events are clearly marked.

This example uses a WebBrick called 'bench' on node 101.  Note that all events start with '02'
This is to avoid confusion with other sample files that may be in the EventDespatch directory
at the same time.

						SOURCE WEBBRICK EVENTS		
		 
		WebBricks generate many types of events, in this case we look for Td 
		and TD.  The difference between these is that Td is created by triggering
		the WebBrick at the Web Interface and TD is created by triggering at the 
		physical input
