	<h1>WebBrick to WebBrick events</h1>

	<p>In this example we listen for events generated on one WebBrick and from these issue actions to
	other WebBricks.
	</p>

	<p>
	As shipped the example is designed to work on a single WebBrick, with only the following configuration changes
	</p>

	<p>Nodename: bench</p>
	<p>Nodenumber: 101</p>

	<p>This configuration is kept away from a new unconfigured WebBrick to avoid any confusion when bringing WebBricks up
	for the first time.</p>

	<p>Note that all the internal events begin with '03'.  This is so that they are mot confused with other similar events
	that might be generated buy having more than one WebBrick to WebBrick event sampple file in the EventDespatch directory.
	</p>

	<h2>Behaviour</h2>

	<p>In this example, Digital Inputs 0,1,2 will trigger Digital Inputs 7,6,5 and after a delay Digital Input 4</p>

	<p> 0 - 7 </p>
	<p> 1 - 6, then after 5 seconds 4</p>
	<p> 2 - 5 </p>

	<h2>File Sections</h2>

	<p>There are three main sections in this file:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>
	'EventHandlers.HttpAction' name='HttpAction'
	</li>
	<li>
	'EventHandlers.DelayedEvent' name='DelayedEvent'
	</li>
	<li>
	'EventHandlers.EventMapper' name='EventMapper'
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>HttpAction</h3>

	<p> This section deals with the TARGET WebBricks and the actions that will be called </p>

	<h3>DelayedEvent</h3>

	<p> This section deals with events that will be directed to the TARGET WebBricks after a delay </p>

	<h3>EvMapper</h3>

	<p> This section deals with mapping events that arrive from:
	<ul>

		<li> URI calls </li>
		<li> WebBrick Web Interfaces </li>
		<li> WebBrick Physical Interfaces </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<pre class="shell">
	    &gt;eventInterface module='EventHandlers.EventMapper' name='EventMapper' &lt;
