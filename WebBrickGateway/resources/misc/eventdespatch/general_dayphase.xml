        This file listens to the 8 dayphase events and allows them to easily be 
        mapped to other events, common events that are used as part of dayphases, 
        and the files which they need to be configured in are: 
        
        
            general_dayphase_mimics.xml
                general/mimics/off
                general/mimics/low
                general/mimics/medium 
                general/mimics/high

                
            general_dayphase_lighting.xml
                general/lighting/comfort/off
                general/lighting/comfort/low
                general/lighting/comfort/medium
                general/lighting/comfort/high
                
                
            outside_dayphase_lighting.xml
                outside/lighting/front/off
                outside/lighting/front/low
                outside/lighting/front/medium
                outside/lighting/front/high
            
                outside/lighting/other/off
