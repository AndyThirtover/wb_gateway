A schedule consists of a set of times and a list of devices that are controlled by that schedule. All devices in the same
schedule have the same set of control times. Although not all devices have to be operated at the time points. Updates to
the time points affect all devices with a control action at that time point.

A schedule may be for a combined set of devices that are interrelated, i.e. a heating system or for a set of devices that are not 
related but have a grouping under some other context, i.e. lighting control based on time of day.

The schedule names, and devices are preconfigured in the application configuration, the remaining control
data is persisted using the persistantce events. The data items all have reletaive URIs andthe first component is
schedule, followed by the schedule name and then the time point number - starting at zero. The schedule processor issues
events to trigger the required action the event type for these is http://id.webbrick.co.uk/events/schedule/control with the
event source being the device name and the action name (on, off, set) In the case of a set action the
event will also have the desired value, e.g. setPoint. The event source does not identify the schedule, this means that 
a device needs a unique name across all schedules and may exist in multiple schedules.

The standard schedule template also will look for events providing the current state of the device, i.e. on off or set level.
