    <h1>zones/heatsource</h1>

        <p>These events are to do with the control/feedback of a single heatsource.</p>

    <h2>General</h2>

        <p>A heatsource is responsible for control of a single heat source.</p> 

    <h3>http://id.webbrick.co.uk/zones/heatsource</h3>
        <p>This is the event type for all events to do with the heatsource.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/run</h3>
        <p>This event source indicates a requirement to run any devices required by to 
        generate heat from this source. The run command may include a request to generate Low or High 
        grade heat.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/dorun</h3>
        <p>This event is issued to get the heat source running, it will periodically be re-issued.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/stop</h3>
        <p>This event source indicates there is now no requirement to run any devices required to generate heat from this source.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/dostop</h3>
        <p>This event is issued to stop the heat source. Some heat sources will be run using dwells
        on the dorun request such that the heat source will stop themselves, 
        this is so that minimum run times are obeyed. Some heat sources will be explicitly stopped.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/running</h3>
        <p>This event source indicates that the heatsource n is running.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/m/dorun</h3>
        <p>Where a heat source consists of multiple units that work together then
        they are referred to by adding a sub component name for the heat source.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/m/dostop</h3>
        <p>Where a heat source consists of multiple units that work together then
        they are referred to by adding a sub component name for the heat source.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/stopped</h3>
        <p>This event source indicates the zone heatsource n has stopped.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/availability</h3>
        <p>This event source indicates the zone heatsource n has some availability, this 
        may be None (0), Low (1), High (2). Low grade can be used to drive some heating zones or a 
        buffer tank but is not capable of driving hot water or radiator systems. 
        Some systems can be told to enter a specific state, i.e. ground source can 
        generate low level heat for under floor.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/inmaintainance</h3>
        <p>Indicates heatsource n is being maintained and for our purposes is unavailable.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/nomaintainance</h3>
        <p>Indicates heatsource n is no longer being maintained and is available.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/m/inmaintainance</h3>
        <p>Indicates heatsource n subcomponent m is being maintained and for our purposes is unavailable.</p>

    <h3>heatsource/n/m/nomaintainance</h3>
        <p>Indicates heatsource n subcomponent m is no longer being maintained and is available.</p>
