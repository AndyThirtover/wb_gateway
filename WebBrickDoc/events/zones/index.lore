    <h1>Introduction</h1>

	<p> When building a solution, the goal is to have as much as possible controlled by the WebBricks.
	</p>

	<p>  Consider an underfloor heating scheme; the room sensor should be connected to the same WebBrick
	as the zone actuator.  In this way the setpoint, or target temperature of the room can be managed locally.
	</p>

	</p>

	<p> The Gateway holds the global intelligence, which in this case would be:

		<li>Occupancy -- are the home users present, does this zone follow Occupancy </li>
		<li>Schedules -- what is the setpoint or running schedules for this zone </li>
		<li>Minima    -- what is the minimum temperature allowed for this zone </li>
	</p>

	<p> The Gateway also holds details on the heat source, or sources that can feed this zone.
	For example this could be a combination of a heat pump and fossil fuel boiler.  These sources might
	feed a number of zones.  The Gateway will call for heat demand from the appropriate source based on
	Occupancy, Global Schedules and Mimina
