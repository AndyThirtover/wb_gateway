    <h1>Kid Templating</h1>

    <p>
    The WebBrick Gateway uses Kid templates to produce the UI which the user can access via their browser. Kid is 
    a simple template language for XML based vocabularies written in Python and can easily be understood by most 
    users that have some experiance with html. For more gerneral information about Kid-Templating please visit: 
    <a href="http://kid-templating.org/">kid-templating.org</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    This sample will introduce the common structure employed in every Kid template to give the WebBrick Gateway UI
    its general look and feel. So firstly the Kid File: 
    <a href="02.03KidTemplating.kid" class="html-listing" />
    And a discussion of each part.
    </p>

    <h2>element: &lt;DOCTYPE ...&gt;</h2>
	<p> 
    To be completed soon.
    </p>
    
    <h2>element: &lt;?python ...&gt;</h2>
    <p>
    To be completed soon. 
    </p>

    <h2>element: &lt;html ...&gt;</h2>
    <p>
    To be completed soon.
    </p>

    
    <h2>element: &lt;body&gt;</h2>
    <p>
    Any thing between the body tags will be part of the actual page body, alike to plain html. Any page content
    should be added here.
    </p>
    

    <h2>element: ${output_nav("...")}</h2>
    <p>
    This is a python function that will load the approritate kid code to produce the default WebBrick Gateway header. 
    The text between the quotes will be displayed centered in the header. 
    </p>


    <h2>element: ${output_site_info_bar()}</h2>

    <p>
    This is a python function that will load the approritate kid code to produce the default WebBrick Gateway footer.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
    To ensure consistency accross all UI pages we advice that every page contains the header and footer elements.
