    <h1>Backup</h1>

        <p>Generate a backup of configutred files.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This event handler can be configured to run a backup of a local set of files. The backup may be a complete
        backup or only the files that have changed since the last backup. The target can be the local file system
        or an HTTP post for offsite backup</p>


    <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>The configuration consists of one or more backup trigger events, these follow the standard
        format and therefore can be set to trigger on all sorts of conditions, typically the backup 
        will be triggered on a time basis. Three sorts of backups can be triggered these are: i) FullBackup, 
        ii) FullBackup if any files in the save set have changed and iii) Delta backup - only files that
        have changed.</p>

    <h3>FileSet</h3>
        A fileset is a list of directories and files that comprise a single backup set.

    <h3>Destination</h3>
        A destination configures the target for a set of files. The transport attribute selects
        the type of disposal method. Currently these can be file for local file creation, ftp for ftp put,
        https for https put and commandline for paassing to the local command shell for disposal.
