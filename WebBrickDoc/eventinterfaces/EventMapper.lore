    <h1>EventMapper</h1>

        <p>Translate any event into one or more new events.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This event handler is typically used to map from one event name to a more user friendly event name, i.e. convert WebBrick
        UDP events from WebBrick and channel numbers to location and device connected.</p>


    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>The handler specific element in this case is called newEvent, this has two attributes for the new event type and source.
    There may be an other_data element and a copy_other_data element, the other_data contains attributes to be attached to the event,
    the copy_other_data specifies attributes to be copied from the originating event. The newEvent element may be repeated.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <a href="EventMapper.xml" class="html-listing" />

    <p>This example creates boiler/IsOn and bolier/IsOff events from WebBrick digital outputs.</p>
