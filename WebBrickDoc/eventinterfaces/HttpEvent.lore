    <h1>HttpEvent</h1>

        <p>Enable an external system to create events.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This event haandler listens for HTTP requests on a configured port and turns the requested URI into an event that
        is then posted into the event distribution network. The event type for these events is always 'http://id.webbrick.co.uk/events/uri'. 
        The event source is requested URI with the leaading / removed.</p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>The only required attribute on the event handler is listenPort, this defines the TCP port that the handler will listen for HTTP
        requests on.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <pre>
    &lt;eventInterface module='EventHandlers.HttpEvent' name='HttpEvent' listenPort='20997' &gt;
    &lt;/eventInterface&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>listen on 20997, this can be tested from any webbrowser by entering for example the following into the browser address bar
    'http://address:20997/an/event' The result will be an event with type=http://id.webbrick.co.uk/events/uri and source=an/event. 
    If you have the event logger configured you can then look in the event log and see the event listed.</p>
    
    <h2>Sample URI</h2>
    
    <pre>
      http://myhome:20997/send/this/event
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>
    You can also insert events by accessing the gateway on the URI /sendevent. In this case all subsequent parts of the URI are used to generate the event source attribute. 
    The event type defaults to http://id.webbrick.co.uk/events/uri but can be overidden by including a type parameter on the URI, all other parameters on the URI are
    turned into other data attributes.

    <pre>
      http://myhome/sendevent/another/new/event?type=internal/val=76
    </pre>
    
    This URI generate an event of type "internal", source is "another/new/event" with a single other data attribute named val.
