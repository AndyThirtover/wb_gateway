    <h1>ValueConvert</h1>

        <p>Convert an event value and generate a new event from it.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This event handler is typically used to convert the val attribute of an event using a simple offset and multiplier.</p>


    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>The handler specific element in this case is called newEvent, 
    this has two attributes for the new event type and source. 
    Two additional attributes must be provided these are offset and multiplier. 
    Following the syntax of EventMapper et al. The contents of the newEvent element may contain 
    other_data and copy_other_data. other_data is used in the event verbatim whilst copy_other_data is
    used to select attributes from the old event and the newVal. If you want the converted number
    you should have a copy_other_data element.

    When an event is selected for processing the newVal 
    attribute is the value of the old event minus the preoffset and then multiplied by the multiplier and then the
    postoffset is added.
    
    If the atributes (preoffset, postoffset and multiplier) are fixed for the conversion, 
    then these can be spcified as atributes in the newEvent tag, see Example 1. Alternatively they can be passed
    in as payload of the incoming event. If the incoming event has payload atributes with the names 
    preoffset, postoffset or multiplier the values of these will override the values specified in the 
    newEvent tag, see Example 2.</p>

    <p>The following can be achieved:
    <ul>
    <li>Add an offset: preoffset=0,multiplier = 1, postoffset=offset.</li>
    <li>Subtract an offset: preoffset=0,multiplier = 1, postoffset= - the offset.</li>
    <li>multiply by a factor: preoffset=0,multiplier = factor, postoffset=0.</li>
    <li>divide by a factor: preoffset=0,divisor = factor, postoffset=0.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Example 1</h2>

    <a href="ValueConvert.xml" class="html-listing" />

    <p>This example, assuming it has a humidity sensor attached, picks an analogue input from a webbrick and converts it into 
    a relative humidity.</p>
    
    <h2>Example 2</h2>

    <a href="ValueConvert2.xml" class="html-listing" />

    <p>This example assumes that the incoming event includes preoffset, postoffset and/or multiplier, 
    to perform the value conversion. If these are not included, then the values speciefied
    in the newEvent tag will be used. Shoud these not exist, then the default values are used. </p>

    <h2>Example 3 - Pressure Sensor</h2>

    <p>Here is a practical example from a pressure sensor with characteristics shown in this graph</p>
