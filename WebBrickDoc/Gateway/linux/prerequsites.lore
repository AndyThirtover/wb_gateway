    <h1>WebBrick Gateway Linux Prerequisites.</h1>

    The Webbrick gateway needs python 2.5 installed on the platform.
    There are packages on the install CD but is is suggested that you use the platforms package manager to handle the 
    software install using a network connection or system CDs.

    <h2>Check python version</h2>
    From a terminal window enter the command <em>python -V</em> (note capital V) to display the python version on your system.You will get an output 
    like <em>Python 2.3.4</em> in this case the version needs upgrading. Use the system package mananger to install version 2.5, ideally 2.5.1. 
    If you receive <em>Python 2.5.0</em> then nothing needs to be done. 

    <h3>Debian</h3>
    Ensure libc6-dev installed.
    Ensure python-dev installed as well as python 2.5.
    apt-get install python2.5-dev
    
    Or use apt-get install python-turbogears to install turbogears.
    
    <h3>Fedora Core</h3>

    <h3>Ubuntu</h3>

    <h3>Red Hat</h3>

    <h3>Source Code</h3>

        Download from python.org http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.4/Python-2.4.4.tgz or locate in the python directory of the install package.
        
        From a command shell change to the directory where you downloaded the source file and enter the following commands.
        <em>tar -xvf Python-2.5.1.tgz</em>
        <em>cd Python-2.5.1.tgz</em>
        <em>./configure</em>
        <em>make</em>
        <em>make install</em>
        
    <h2>Turbogears</h2>
    The Webbrick Gateway uses the TurboGears framework to generate user interfaces. This can be installed over the Internet
    or from local files.

    <h3>Net install</h3>
    Download <em>http://www.turbogears.org/download/tgsetup.py</em> or locate in the Turbogears folder of the install media.
    
    Start a command shell and go to where downloaded to or to the Turbogears folder on the install kit. Enter the command <em>python tgsetup.py</em>

    <h3>Local install</h3>
    Start a command shell and go to the Turbogears folder on the install kit. Enter the command <em>python tgsetup.py -f . TurboGears-1.0.3.2-py2.5.egg</em>

    <h2>Serial support</h2>
    The gateway can connect to devices over serial connections and uses pyserial for this support. This again can be installed over the Internet
    or from local files.

    <h3>Net install</h3>
    Start a command shell, Enter the command <em>easy_install pyserial</em>

    <h3>Local install</h3>
    Start a command shell and go to the python folder on the install kit. Enter the command <em>easy_install pyserial2.2.zip</em>
