WebBrickBeta

This egg is intended to hold code that is being developed against the released product that may require
installing on customer machines. The aim is to deliver new versions of the main distribution eggs no more than 
4 times a year.

At present the WebBrick Gateway that is installed on customer machines haas a habbit of being built specifically for them and
therefore we have no single version in the field.
