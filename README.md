wb_gateway
==========

This is the open sourced code for the webbrick systems home gateway.

As part of the winding up of Webbrick Systems Ltd. the codebase is being open sourced.
It is being released under the 3 clause BSD licence. 

Note there is code in the repo that
did not belong to Webrick Systems and is still covered by its own licence/copyright terms.
This code was included in the webbrick systems source control so as to have a stable base
for the gateway developments.
