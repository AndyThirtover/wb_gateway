Now please read the manual.

From a command prompt webbrick_doc will start a webbrowser with the documentation.

If you chose not to install the gateway as a service the command start-WebBrickGateway.py will start the
gateway.

Your Webbrick Gateway can be access from Start/Programs/Webbrick Gateway/My WebBrick Gateway or
localhost:8080 in a browser address bar, from other systems you will need to replace
localhost by the address or name of the server.python


Log files will be in:
XP - \Documents And Settings\All Users\Application Data\Webbrick\Gateway\logs
Vista - \PROGRAM DATA\Webbrick\Gateway\logs

For now use registry editor to access:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebBrick Gateway\Parameters]
And change 
"ConfigurationFile"="/path/to/mysite/prod.cfg"

Then stop and restart the Webbrick gateway service.
