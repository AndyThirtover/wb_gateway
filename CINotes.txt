Continuous Integration framework notes
--------------------------------------

The key files are used on system webbricksystems-ci, [10,200.0.4] on the 
Thirtover network are in directory /var/WebBrickCI, also in the subversion /HomeGateway2/Trunk directory:
  CITests.conf - configures test cases to be run:
                 succcess is determined by zero exit status of the 
                 given test commands
  RunCITests.sh - updates the repository mirrors, updates (or replaces)
                  a local working copy of code and runs the tests.
                  Has various options -n try RunCITests.sh ?, or look
                  at latest source in subversion
  UpdateCITests.sh - a simple script to pull the latest CI files from
                     the current repository working copy into the CI 
                     working directory

Thus:
  RunCITests.sh
  UpdateCITests.sh
  RunCITests.sh

To runs tests using latest CI scripts and config from subversion.

TODO:
  add more test cases to CITests.conf
  get Andy to allow notification emails through his relay
  configure to run routinely, automatically
  add additional development environment as needed
  review security setup - the CI system to have read-only access 
  to the mirror repository?

FUTURE:
  put repository details in test config file
  allow multiple test config files (ala Apache conf.d, etc) so that
  new test suites can be added and maintained independently.
